# GemDrop
Small 2D game made in Unity and published to itch.io.

Play it [here](https://gamedotplay.itch.io/gem-drop)!

This project initially used Unity's Plastic SCM for version control but then migrated here to GitHub so there is no commit history from development unfortunately.

Collect gems in the crates to progress through the dangerous caves!
